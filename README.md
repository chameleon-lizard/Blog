# Simple blog script

Just a simple thing cause I'm too lazy to upload blogposts to my VPS. Hack it as you wish.

[Example](https://chameleon-lizard.ru/blog/blog.html).

## Dependencies

- python-markdown

## Usage

Change the config file so it contains your credentials.
Then `chmod +x postit`, then `postit -i <directory_with_the_blogpost>`.
It has to have `"assets"` directory with images to work properly.
